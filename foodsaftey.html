                <h3>Foods to Avoid</h3>
                <p>To keep your bearded dragon healthy you will need to make sure they stay on their diet. There are also some foods which are unhealthy for them or lethal for them to eat. Make sure they do not eat any of the below items:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Lettuce</dt>
                    <dd>Since lettuce is mostly water it is not nutritious for bearded dragons. Because of this it is best to avoid feeding your bearded dragon lettuce or any greens with the word "lettuce" in the name.</dd>
                    <dt>Spinach</dt>
                    <dd>Spinach is also another food to avoid. While spinach is healthy, calcium binds easily to it which can make it hard for your bearded dragon to digest.</dd>
                    <dt>Insects Captured in the Wild</dt>
                    <dd>Never feed your bearded dragon any insects you catch yourself. The insects you catch probably have parasites on them and contain trace amounts of pesticides, both of which can make your bearded dragon sick.</dd>
                    <dt>Fireflies or Insects that Glow</dt>
                    <dd>If a bug or insect glows in the dark, then do not feed it to your bearded dragon. Even one of these bugs can be lethal to an adult bearded dragon.</dd>
                    <dt>Avocados</dt>
                    <dd>Do not feed your bearded dragons avocados. They are toxic, but their toxicity levels are unknown; however, they are deadly for birds.</dd>
                </dl>
