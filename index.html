                <h3>Bearded Dragon History</h3>
                <p>
                    Bearded dragons are only naturally found in Australia's desert regions. Generally they are found in the southeastern Northern Territory and the eastern half of South Australia. Their habitats included woodlands, savannahs, and
                    deserts. It is not uncommon to find them basking in branches, on stumps, or rocks during the morning there.
                    Bearded dragons were not introduced to the United States until the 1990's. Since then they have dramatically increased in popularity and can be found in just about every major pet store.

                    How Big Do Bearded Dragons Get
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The size and length of a bearded dragon depends on a couple of factors including:

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The species/breed</li>
                    <li>Their environment</li>
                    <li>Their diet and health</li>
                    <li>Their sex</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Bearded Dragon Species Size <br>
                The most common bearded dragon species is the Pogona Vitticeps, so the chances are if you have a bearded dragon, is is this species. The chart below shows the max size based on the type of bearded dragon, but keep in mind that
                        most dragons will not grow to be as big as their max size.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pogona Vitticeps - 24 Inches</li>
                    <li>Pogona Barbata - 24 Inches</li>
                    <li>Pogona Minor Mitchelli - 18 Inches</li>
                    <li>Pogona Minor Minor - 14 to 18 Inches</li>
                    <li>Pogona Nullabor - 14 Inches</li>
                    <li>Pogona Henrylawsoni - 12 Inches</li>
                    <li>Pogona Minor Minima - 12 Inches</li>
                    <li>Pogona Microlepidota - 4 to 6 Inches</li>
                </ul>

                <dl>
                    <dt>Bearded Dragon Size Based on Environment</dt>
                    <dd>Bearded dragons will only grow to the max size that their environment allows. This means if you put a young bearded dragon (that's not finished growing) in a cage/tank that is too small , then they will not be able to grow to theirfull size.</dd>
                    <dt>Bearded Dragon Size Based on Diet and Health</dt>
                    <dd>A healthy bearded dragon will grow faster and larger than a dragon that is malnourished or unhealthy. You can ensure a bearded dragon reaches his or her full size by correctly feeding your bearded dragon and making sure your beardeddragon stays healthy.</dd>
                    <dt>Bearded Dragon Size Based on Sex</dt>
                    <dd>Like a majority of animals, the males are generally larger than females. So if your bearded dragon is a male your dragon will likely grow to be a larger dragon.</dd>
